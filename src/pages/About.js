          <h2>üß† What is SmartLearnify AI‚ÄîIn Essence?</h2>
          <p>
            SmartLearnify AI is not just educational software‚Äîit's an AGI-native educational operating system. 
            Think of it as the "operating system for Pakistan's future classrooms", powered by Arthur, 
            an artificial general intelligence agent developed using the Ava-Education‚Ñ¢ model.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's personalized, localized, scalable, multilingual, offline-capable, and dynamically responsive 
            to each student's unique learning profile (LCP). It serves as a digital tutor, curriculum planner, 
            assessment system, and institutional insight engine‚Äîall in one.
